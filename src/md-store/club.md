      Our designers take on a variety of different kinds of requests to support
      the student and local community. We provide pro-bono designs for flyers,
      banners, logos, and more for on-campus clubs. We also take on branding
      projects from local businesses and startups with our advanced design team.

      Our photographers document the happenings of the campus and the city. We
      work on client requests such as event photography, portraiture, or studio
      and product photography, and we provide ample space for our photographers
      to explore their aesthetic on their own through personal projects.
